Assignment: 5

Contribution:
Louis - I worked mainly on the implementing regserver.py by creating multiple
        processes. I also worked on the error handling by making sure all the
        errors we had missed have been fixed. I also extensively tested our code. 

Herve - I readapted our code for reg.py by incorporating threads and queue for
        responsiveness. I also helped on some errors that we had missed in
        Assignment 2. I did a lot of the GUI formatting and event handling.
